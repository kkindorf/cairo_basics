// a crate is the smallest amount of code that the cairo compiler considers at a time
// crates contain modules
// modules are defined in other files that get compiled into the crate
// pretty much every directory so far in this repo has been made into a crate 

// the root of a crate is lib.cairo

// a cairo package is a bundle of one or more creates with a scarb.toml file that describes how to build those crates 
//allows code splitting and dependency management
